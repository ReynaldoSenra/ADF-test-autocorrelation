# Requires the library urca. In Windows or Mac go to the menu of RStudio and click on Tools and after on Install Packages...Â 
# Then, in "Packages (separate multiple with space or comma):" write "urca" (without the quotes) and RStudio will install the urca package.
# Just in case, go to the low-right side panel of the screen of RStudio and click in the Packages window. Then, search there 
# the urca package and verify that it is checkmarked.
# To load your data go the menu of RStudio and click on File and after on Import Dataset.
# Very probably your data will be imported as data.frame. Imagine that you called mydata the data.frame that you imported in R.
# To make it a matrix you only need to write the following command in the R console:
mydata<-as.matrix(mydata)

# Explanation of the arguments:
# x is the database with the series which you want to perform the unit root tests. It should contain only one series.
# type, lags, selectlags are the arguments of the ur.df function of the urca R package (you can see the documentation of this package if you need more information).
# order and order.by are arguments of the bgtest R function. Here, order accounts for upto wich order of autocorrelation you want to account in the ADF test.
# q is the maximun lag that you are willing to reach when trying to correct the autocorrelation. You should set q larger that lags.
# pvalu is the significance level at which you want to perform the Breush Godfrey test
